NOTE TO MYSELF
-------------------
I would like to start my creative coding and save all my practices here.
Hopefully I have this enthusiasm for this as the days go.
Also using this opportunity to learn how to github and all the repository stuff
Now I'm going to put this version in a separate branch as a sample.
This is another sample branch that's been created
